# MostLikedBot

A simple twitter BOT that every night at midnight (UTC) computes, quote tweets and likes the most liked tweet of that day. The bot provides general information about the most liked tweet, such as the owner of the tweet, the number of likes, retweets and other. The master branch is for running the bot on a local machine. The other branch (google-cloud-function) is for running the bot on google cloud as a function without needing to have your local machine turned on.

To use the bot, you will need to add your authentication details for twitter API to the class ``Secrets``. The skeleton for secrets is already provided.

The project was done as a personal learning experience to get better at APIs. Check the bot out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/MostLikedBOT) and give it a follow!
