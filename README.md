# MostLikedBot

A simple twitter BOT that every night at midnight (UTC) computes, quote tweets and likes the most liked tweet of that day. The bot provides general information about the most liked tweet, such as the owner of the tweet, the number of likes, retweets and other.

The project was done as a personal learning experience to get better at APIs.
